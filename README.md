### Hi 👋

I'm a Lead, Senior ML Engineer, with a focus on nlp, mlops & software in production.

I have been the main maintainer of [modelkit](https://github.com/Cornerstone-OnDemand/modelkit), a minimalist mlops python framework, for a few years.

I have contributed to the following projects: 🤗 [huggingface/smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents), [huggingface/llm-vscode](https://github.com/huggingface/llm-vscode), [carbonfact/lea](https://github.com/carbonfact/lea)

I have a few additional side projects, such as 🍊 [daidai](https://huggingface.co/datasets/antoinejeannot/daidai), ⚖️ [Jurisprudence](https://huggingface.co/datasets/antoinejeannot/jurisprudence), 📔 [Paul Graham Compilation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/antoinejeannot/graham), 🖋️ [nuggets](https://github.com/antoinejeannot/nuggets), [minimalist LLM-powered git message](https://gist.github.com/antoinejeannot/efaa44a9de5b10024eac993034ce3a62) and some hidden ones in theft mode.
