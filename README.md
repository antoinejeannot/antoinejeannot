### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently working as a Lead ML Engineer, with a focus on NLP, MLOps & Software
- 🌱 I'm also maintainer of [modelkit](https://github.com/Cornerstone-OnDemand/modelkit), a minimalist MLOps Python framework
- ⚖️ Curious about legal tech, I built [Jurisprudence](https://huggingface.co/datasets/antoinejeannot/jurisprudence) which fetches, consolidates & distributes French legal decisions, automatically
- 📖 From time to time, I try to document my thoughts and appreciation for topics or resources I have found valuable in [nuggets](https://github.com/antoinejeannot/nuggets)
- 🏔️ You can find me near Paris or hiking in the Pyrénées

Here are some (~somewhat) cool hacks / `gits`:
- 🏃🏻‍♂️ When I want to ship fast, I enable [Minimalist LLM-powered git message](https://gist.github.com/antoinejeannot/efaa44a9de5b10024eac993034ce3a62)
